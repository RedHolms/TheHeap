# The Heap
The repository's name speaks for itself. This repository - is just a heap of projects, which transforms in one big project. In programming and computer science I've been interested in low-level things. High-level languages(Python, Lua, JS and etc.), frameworks, and all easly to learning things just don't attractive for me. In this project I'll try to impliment all from scratch, using only OS tools and already created in this project modules. Such as Feynman said: "*What I cannot create, I do not understand*". Most of projects in repository will be programmed in C or C++, but maybe I will try to use other languages for *variety*.

Here's list of project to do:
   - [X] Memory Alocator
   - [ ] Networking module
   - [ ] Assebmly-like simple programming language
   - [ ] Event System
   - [X] Logger
   - [ ] Unit Test Module
   - [ ] Hashtable(Associative array)
